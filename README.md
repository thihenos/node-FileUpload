### What I need ?

* SublimeText or other file editor
* NPM
* Node JS
* Express, node network app framework
* Multer, middleware for handling multipart/form-data

### Installation
Fist, install NPM for Node.JS managing packages. ( Just make sure, this is a Ubuntu example )

```sh
sudo apt-get install npm
```
Then, install Node.js

```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
Download the project, and inside the folder, just run for dependences installation
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Test
In app.js file, I configurated the http PORT to 3000, you can change as you wanted, so, in this example, when start this example, it will be released in localhost:3000 address :)

So, open your favorite Terminal and run these command.
```sh
$ node app
```
